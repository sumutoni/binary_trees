# Binary Trees
## Task 0
Write a function that creates a binary tree node

## Task 1
Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node.
If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.

## Task 2
Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node.
If parent already has a right-child, the new node must take its place, and the old right-child must be set as the right-child of the new node.

## Task 3
Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree

## Task 4
Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf

## Task 5
Write a function that checks if a given node is a root

## Task 6
function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal

## Task 7
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal

## Task 8
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal

## Task 9
Write a function that measures the height of a binary tree

## Task 10
Write a function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree

## Task 11
Write a function that measures the size of a binary tree

## Task 12
Write a function that counts the leaves in a binary tree

## Task 13
Write a function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree

## Task 14
Write a function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree

## Task 15
Write a function that checks if a binary tree is full

## Task 16
Write a function that checks if a binary tree is perfect

## Task 17
Write a function that finds the sibling of a node

## Task 18
Write a function that finds the uncle of a node
